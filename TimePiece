# My Straw Hat Pirate Watch Face

Hey everyone! I recently created a custom watch face for my Huawei, inspired by the world of *One Piece*. If you're a fan of the anime and looking for something new for your watch, check it out!

## Watch Face Overview

This design combines classic watch aesthetics with a pirate twist. The background features a deep blue color with striking golden accents. 

- **Center Design**: The middle has a complex mechanical core, giving it a sleek, techy look.
- **Hour Hand**: Styled like an underwater sword, embracing the pirate theme.
- **Second Hand**: Shaped like Luffy’s hat for a fun touch.
- **Markers**: At 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, you’ll find the Jolly Rogers of the New Generation Yonko.
- **Details**: Two circular windows display the date and battery life.

The whole face is framed with elements resembling ship gears, adding a subtle adventurous vibe.
